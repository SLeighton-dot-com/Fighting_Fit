### Hosting
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Used to host the deployed version of this project

## Deployment
### Deploying To Heroku
The following instructions are based on the user running VSCode on Windows 10. The process remains the same ff you are using a different IDE or OS, but your commands maybe slightly different.

You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (ideally the latest version) installed on your machine. You will also need [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) which comes with Python versions 3.4 and later. Having [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is also highly recommended.


- Save a copy of the repo on your local machine or use ``git clone https://github.com/SLeighton-dot-com/Fighting_Fit``.

Please make sure that before you follow these steps that:
- The app has been deployed locally and then pushed to your own GitHub account.
- You have created and configured an [AWS S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for serving the media files and static
- You have a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account for taking payments

If you have the above in place follow the these steps:
- In your `settings.py` file add the following code
```
import os(<Ensure this is at the head of the file>)

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [<This will be the URL that Heroku assigned to your deployed site>]

# Email
if 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = '<fightingfit@example.com>'
else:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'(<The Outgoing Mail Server for your email, for example `smtp.gmail.com`>)
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')

#Stripe
load_dotenv()
STRIPE_CURRENCY = 'usd'
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
```

- Go to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com) and log in or create an account.
- Click `New` to add a new app, give it a name, choose a region and click `Create app`.
- On the `Setttings`  tab add the config var 'DATABASE_URL' and then copy in your `postgres//....` database url.
- From your local IDE, in your `settings.py` file, under `DATABASES` section add the following code 
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
- Also in `settings.py` add the following code for AWS
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'fighting-fit'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2' (Or what server is closest to you)
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
- In your terminal run `python3 manage.py showmigrations`, you should see a list of the migrations and none of them should be checked off showing that your local deployment is now connected to the remote Postgres db, so you can run:
- `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database
- `python manage.py loaddata categories` to load the categories
- `python manage.py loaddata products` to load the products
- `python manage.py createsuperuser` to set up your admin account.
- Go to your Postgress DB (I used Elephant SQL) and navigate to `Browser` click `Table queries` and the `auth_user`, click `Execute` and you should see your superuser details displayed.
- Go back to the Dashboard, and from the `Setttings` tab, click the `Reveal Config Vars` button and add the following key / value pairs
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` - The email address you want the app to send emails from
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` - The password for above email address
	- `SECRET_KEY` - Use a Django Secret Key Gen, for example [this one](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/).
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your Stripe API `Public key`
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe API `Secret key`
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` - This is your Webhook link for STRIPE
	- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS Access Key
	- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS Secret Access Key
	- `USE_AWS` - Set this to `TRUE`
- Back in the Heroku Dashboard, click the `Deploy` tab and scroll down to `Deployment Method`. Select `GitHub` and link your account and repository.
- Scroll down further to `Automatic deploys` for Heroku to update your deployed site after you commit changes to Github. 
- Scroll down to `Manual Deploy`, choose the branch you wish to deploy and click `Deploy Branch`
- Wait for the app to build, and once complete, click `view` to launch your app in the browser.
- Log in with the superuser details you created and navigate to the admin panel at `your-deployment-url/admin`
